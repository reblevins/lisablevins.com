Lisa has been making a lot of new sentences lately, but mostly in Dutch, of course, since that is what she hears the most. I keep speaking English with her, which she seems to understand. I&#8217;ll write the phrases in Dutch and try and translate them into English.

As evidence that she is starting to get it, the other day, out of the blue, she said to her mom, &#8220;Daddy spreekt engels&#8221;, Daddy speaks English.

She&#8217;s also getting the hang of what we call &#8220;Denglish&#8221; which is a combination of Dutch and English, which is what my wife and I speak most of the time. In the car the other day, she responded to a question that I asked with: &#8220;I know niet!&#8221; (&#8220;niet&#8221; means &#8220;not&#8221; as you can probably guess.)

She&#8217;s also good at parroting, as most kids are. She hears us say something and then saves it for what seems to her the appropriate time. A few days ago, I noticed a rash on her chest where we had been applying vicks for her cold. As she was scratching it, she said earnestly, &#8220;Niet aankomen, Lisa, gevaarlijk!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch, Lisa, dangerous.&#8221;

There are many more examples like these. We&#8217;ll try and keep you updated as much as possible.
