If Jesus made us, then who made Jesus? Well, how do you explain that to a five-year-old?
  
My best answer was that He has always been there.
  
Her response: &#8220;Well, if He has always been there, then 100 is not very old.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right, 100 is not very old,&#8221; I said.
