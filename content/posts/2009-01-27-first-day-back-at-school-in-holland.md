Yesterday (Monday, Jan 26th) Lisa insisted on going to school, so we took her in the afternoon. Again this morning, she was crying the whole morning that she wanted to go to school, so we took her at 10:30.

We thought she might be too tired to go back this afternoon (in Holland they almost always come home for lunch break), but she wanted to go back. The only thing was, she told her mom last night that it was so hard at school because she had to speak Dutch again and that the kids couldn’t understand her.

Poor thing, she doesn’t know which continent she’s on. One positive thing was she was speaking English to me in the car this afternoon!
