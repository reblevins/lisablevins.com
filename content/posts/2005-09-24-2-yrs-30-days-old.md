Lisa is two years and 30 days old today.

She is learning so many new words lately, that it is difficult to keep up with. Still, I&#8217;ll try and give you a few examples.

This last week she can now say:  
more  
too  
She repeated the words &#8220;teddy bear&#8221; after me.

She is learning many new Dutch words, too, she can say:  
liggen (lie down)  
zitten (sit)  
zo (so, like that)

Her Dutch is going faster, for obvious reasons, namely that her mother spends more time talking with her than I do. She learns a lot of English from her two little neighbor girls.

She&#8217;s also starting to form short sentences, like the following example that happened on Friday, September 23rd:  
She was playing outside and I called out &#8220;I love you!&#8221; As I walked away, out of the blue she called back &#8220;love you too!&#8221; I wheeled around surprised and she started to laugh as if she knew she had done something special.
