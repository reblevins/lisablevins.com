For instance, the other day, we had just come home after Jolanda and Lisa had spent a week with Jo&#8217;s dad. Jo and Lisa had talked to her Dad on the phone and after they hung up, Jo was crying. She has learned to say that Oma is in heaven, and Oma is with jesus. Out of the blue Lisa asked, in Dutch, &#8220;did Opa go to Jesus, too?&#8221; That helped lighten the moment a little, as you can imagine.

On the English front, she is speaking more and more English, and learning when she needs to speak English instead of Dutch. One day last week, Jo was baby-sitting, three missionary kids from India. At one point, lisa wanted to get a car back from one of the boys. She put her hand out and said, English, &#8220;boy car back please!&#8221;

She also often knows better what something is called. For instance, when we were in Jo&#8217;s home town earlier in January, we kept driving past windmills and she would call out &#8220;molen!&#8221; and I would say, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a windmill&#8221; and she would respond, &#8220;nee, molen!&#8221; (nee = no). We would go back and forth like that until I would finally give up. Finally, we were going through a book together and there was a windmill in the book and she called it a &#8220;molen&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yes, and Daddy says &#8216;windmill'&#8221;. She put her hand behind my head and playfully forced it towards the book, with a smile saying repeatedly, &#8220;molen! molen!&#8221;

She also used the past tense in Dutch the night before last, when I&#8217;m sure is not normal for her age.

She loves to dance and sing. She sings her own songs she makes up, but she also sings, &#8220;Yes, Jesus loves me, yes Jesus Bible so!&#8221; Lisa is our little comedian and actress. She keeps us smiling and laughing with the funny things she says and all of her funny facial expressions.

And last, but not least, we want to introduce Lisa&#8217;s very own Videoblog, also know as a vlog. Just right-click (command-click on the mac) on the picture below and choose to save the file (mac: Download Linked File).
