Lisa had already learned how to say &#8220;ush&#8221; (shoes) while she was in Arizona, but today she surprised us again. I was standing in the kitchen, and all of a sudden I heard the click-clack of little shoes, and to my surprise she had managed to put on her little white patent shoes all by herself! While being easier to get on than boots or tennis shoes, they&#8217;re still not very easy to put on. -RB
