Here’s a big Lisa update all in one post. Sorry it’s been so long since we&#8217;ve updated you.

Words Lisa can say:  
mama  
daddy  
bear  
dauto (auto)  
this  
nini (bikini)  
![Lisa in the swimming pool][1]

Cute things she does:  
If we don’t respond to her when she calls us mama or daddy, she will call us by our first names! “Jo”, “Ronny”

She fills sentences in with “na”. “This na na na na bear na na na na” is an example sentence.

We got her a cheap, toy stroller that she just loves. She puts her baby in it, or her stuffed animals and pushes them around. For a while she was even insisting on sitting in it herself (she’s way to big, but that didn’t matter).

She has two friends (sisters) who live next door, Kenisha and Tessa. In the beginning they fought a lot but now they are as thick as thieves.
