We were talking about going to see Santa Claus and Lisa asked if it was the real one or not. I hesitantly answered yes to which she responded that it couldn’t be since it hadn’t snowed yet. We were at a Christmas Eve service where a couple with their young baby was playing Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus. Lisa’s first reaction was: “That’s a real baby!” Later on she asked me if that was the real Mary and the real Jesus. When I answered no she responded: “Oh, so they’re fake.”
