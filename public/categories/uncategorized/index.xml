      <description>Today, Lisa turned six years old! She got to take treats to school (which is a Dutch tradition called “trakteren”). We also had a birthday party for her at Heidebeek for everyone. It was great fun!
Her Aunt Sylvia and her cousins Sabine and Valerie were also here for a couple of days. Uncle Jan and Aunt Cindy and Opa were visiting in the weekend.
Happy Birthday, Lisa!</description>

      <title>Who made Jesus?</title>

      <description>While putting my daughter to bed the other night, she asked me a whopper of a question.
If Jesus made us, then who made Jesus? Well, how do you explain that to a five-year-old?
My best answer was that He has always been there.
Her response: “Well, if He has always been there, then 100 is not very old.”
“Yes, you’re right, 100 is not very old,” I said.</description>

Lisa keeps on surprising us with what she can say and not only that, but the things she comes up with.
For instance, the other day, we had just come home after Jolanda and Lisa had spent a week with Jo’s dad. Jo and Lisa had talked to her Dad on the phone and after they hung up, Jo was crying. She has learned to say that Oma is in heaven, and Oma is with jesus.</description>

Lisa has been making a lot of new sentences lately, but mostly in Dutch, of course, since that is what she hears the most. I keep speaking English with her, which she seems to understand. I’ll write the phrases in Dutch and try and translate them into English.
As evidence that she is starting to get it, the other day, out of the blue, she said to her mom, “Daddy spreekt engels”, Daddy speaks English.</description>

      <description>Lisa is two years and 30 days old today.
She is learning so many new words lately, that it is difficult to keep up with. Still, I’ll try and give you a few examples.
This last week she can now say:
more
too
She repeated the words “teddy bear” after me.
She is learning many new Dutch words, too, she can say:
liggen (lie down)
zitten (sit)
zo (so, like that)</description>

      <description>Here’s a big Lisa update all in one post. Sorry it’s been so long since we’ve updated you.
Words Lisa can say:
mama
daddy
bear
dauto (auto)
this
nini (bikini)
Cute things she does:
If we don’t respond to her when she calls us mama or daddy, she will call us by our first names! “Jo”, “Ronny”
She fills sentences in with “na”. “This na na na na bear na na na na” is an example sentence.</description>

      <description>Lisa had already learned how to say “ush” (shoes) while she was in Arizona, but today she surprised us again. I was standing in the kitchen, and all of a sudden I heard the click-clack of little shoes, and to my surprise she had managed to put on her little white patent shoes all by herself! While being easier to get on than boots or tennis shoes, they’re still not very easy to put on.</description>

      <description>This last weekend, Lisa went with Mommy and Daddy to see the sheep and the lambs!
The sheep in picture number three bleated really loudly in her face and made her cry, but other than that she had a great time.</description>
