Lisa loves using her hands: drawing, cutting figures out with scissors, baking. She is showing great skill in it too. Sheâ€™ll take a magazine and cut out some very small figures. She is also loves to draw and she seems to be good at it. Check out her drawings of a cat and a clown face.
The other day she baked cookies with her mom.</description>
