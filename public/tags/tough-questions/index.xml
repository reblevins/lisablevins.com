      <description>While putting my daughter to bed the other night, she asked me a whopper of a question.
If Jesus made us, then who made Jesus? Well, how do you explain that to a five-year-old?
My best answer was that He has always been there.
Her response: “Well, if He has always been there, then 100 is not very old.”
“Yes, you’re right, 100 is not very old,” I said.</description>
